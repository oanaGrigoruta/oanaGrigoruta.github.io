This is me trying the first post blog thing. Here is an image added, first one with an html format, the second one as an md. format. Also trying some math notations, 5^5, tabs,
    Here is a tab added, **balds**, italic* 
And here is a tab with "\" \
now let's try the images with html because it offers alignment

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" src="/blog_images/test.jpg">
</p>
