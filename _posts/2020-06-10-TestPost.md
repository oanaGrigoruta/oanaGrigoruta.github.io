**Abstract**

The goal of this report is to describe to users of the TUH EEG Corpus four important concepts that must be understood to correctly retrieve EEG signals from a data file (e.g., an EDF file). The four key concepts described in this document are: (1) _physical placement_: the location of the electrodes on the scalp, (2) _unipolar montage_: the differential recording process used to reduce noise, (3) _channel labels_: the system used to describe the channels, or digital signals, represented in a computer file and (4) _bipolar montages_: the differential mapping used to accentuate clinically-relevant events in the signal. This report is not intended to be a primer on the electrophysiology of an EEG, which is a subject unto itself, or a tutorial on how neurologists interpret EEGs. This report simply explains how the signal data in an EEG file must be accessed to accurately support clinical applications (e.g., manual interpretation or annotation of an EEG) and research applications (e.g., automatic interpretation using machine learning).

1. **Introduction**

An electroencephalogram (EEG) (Tong &amp; Thakor, 2009) is a vital tool for monitoring the brain&#39;s electrical activity and diagnosing various neural diseases. The Temple University Hospital EEG (TUEG) Corpus (Obeid &amp; Picone, 2016) was developed to support state of the art research into automatic interpretation of EEGs using machine learning (Golmohammadi et al., 2019). The corpus consists of EEG signal data and paired EEG reports written by the attending neurologist for each patient session. The signal data is stored in an open-source European Data Format (EDF) file, (Kemp, 2013) while the reports are stored as flat text files. The header of each EDF file contains fundamental metadata information about every patient session that is evenly distributed over 24 fields that display patient information and signal condition. There are several other valuable subsets and annotations of the data (Veloso et al., 2017) that are available from our project web site (Choi et al., 2017).

This corpus consists entirely of clinical data collected from 2002 to the present at Temple University Hospital (TUH). The EEG signal data was collected using various generations of EEG equipment. Most of the data from 2002 – 2019 was collected using Natus Medical Incorporated&#39;s (NMI) NicoletOne recording equipment (Natus, 2019). Unfortunately, this system stores the data in a proprietary format developed by Natus. The signal data was exported from the source EEG files to an open source publicly accessible format using NMI&#39;s proprietary NicVue software tool (NicVue, 2019). The signal data that is stored represents a pruned EEG in which sections of the EEG signal marked as uninformative by the attending technician were removed. One or more EDF files are generated from a signal source file based on these pruning instructions provided by the attending technician. A direct result of this is that the Natus tool only outputs pruned data, so we had no way of releasing the entire original recording. This is still an area under research as we continue to evaluate open source tools that claim to be able to reverse engineer the Natus proprietary format.

A point we have continually emphasized throughout our long history with EEG technology development is that clinical data is messy. The data in TUEG was collected from a variety of locations in the hospital including the intensive care unit (ICU), the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), the emergency room (ER) and outpatient services (the 5th floor of Boyer Pavilion). Because these sessions cover the full range of EEGs conducted at TUH, there are a broad range of channel configurations and channel labels used to describe the EEG data. In fact, there are over 40 unique channel configurations contained within the entire corpus. The EDF format uses an ASCII representation for the header contained within the file while the signal data is stored as a multichannel signal in which samples are encoded as 16-bit integers. Signal channels within this file are described by labels that can be used to infer the original physical location of the electrode and the meaning of the channel.

**There is no guarantee that the channels that comprise an EEG signal appear in the file in the same order.** A common mistake made by many rudimentary software packages is that they read the data into a matrix and assume the channels are always in the same order. A key portion of an EDF file that contains the labels is shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, each channel is labeled, and each channel must be accessed via its label and/or position in this list rather than its absolute position in the file. For example, there is no constraint that the channel labeled &quot;EEG FP1-REF&quot; is always the first channel. This channel can appear in many positions across TUEG.

Therefore, the primary goal of this report is to document the labels that appear in this corpus and to explain how these can be mapped back to the physical locations of the sensors. We have developed a visualization tool (Capp et al., 2017) that simplifies visualizing and manipulating these channels by their labels. We provide a program, _nedc\_pystream_, that is easy to use and demonstrates how to correctly access the data. This Python code is available from our project web site (Choi et al., 2017).

Most commercial packages offer similar capabilities, since clinicians need to be able to manipulate channels symbolically. Interpreting labels can only be done through auxiliary documentation, such as that provided in this report. Channel labels, though often similar across institutions, are not guaranteed to be common across institutions (e.g., institution X might not use the label &quot;EEG FP1-REF&quot;). Only through documentation such as that provided in this report, can one reverse map the data in an EDF file.

When an EEG is administered, a technician wires up a patient with a specific electrode configuration. This includes deciding on the number of channels to be collected, the locations of the electrodes on the scalp, and the reference points used for the electrical signals. These &quot;raw&quot; signals, which are digitized versions of the electrical potential measured between an electrode and a reference point, are stored in an EEG file. We discuss the issues of electrode placement, which we refer to in this document as the _physical configuration_, in Section 2. We discuss the process of differential voltage recording, which is referred to as a _unipolar montage_, in Section 3.

Each channel that is recorded is identified by a label (e.g., &quot;EEG FP1-REF&quot;) as shown in Figure 1. These labels, unfortunately, are specific to an institution, neurologist or technician. We discuss the interpretation of _channel labels_ in Section 4. In Appendix B we list every channel label that appears at least once in the corpus, and the number of files in which it appears. The specific electrode location that corresponds to each of these labels is not known since most of this data was collected long before we engaged Temple Hospital, and the associated documentation has been lost over time. Nevertheless, we have attempted to provide some useful information about the origin of these labels.

It is also important to understand that when neurologists view an EEG, they impose a montage on the data. This is most often simply a list of channel pairs to be differenced and is commonly referred to as a _bipolar montage_. This type of montage is described in detail in Section 5. Note that this differencing is in addition to the differencing done to record the raw signal. A bipolar montage is imposed when the data is viewed or processed and is not actually stored in the data file. Neurologists will often view the same EEG using several different montages depending on what specific events they are looking to enhance. Software that loads an EEG and displays the results is responsible for implementing the montage view. This software must provide some way of directing which channels are to be differenced. As mentioned previously, we provide software that demonstrates how to do this in Python. Most commercial packages offer similar capabilities, since these bipolar montages are used heavily in clinical work. Although there are many popular montages used in practice (e.g., TCP), some expert clinicians prefer their own definitions. Imposing a bipolar montage is critical for machine learning researchers since they will often use the output of a bipolar montage as a starting point for their algorithm research.

1. **Physical Configuration of the Electrodes**

Figure 2. ACNS map of the International 10-20 system and its corresponding channels on an EEG.

The most widely used arrangement of electrodes in electroencephalographic recordings is the International 10/20 system. In this system, 21 electrodes on the scalp are evenly distributed as seen in Figure 2 (López, 2017), with the distance between electrodes being either 10% or 20% of the total distance from nasion (front) to inion (back). The 10/20 system utilizes four anatomical landmarks for positioning: the point between the forehead and nose (nasion), the lowest point of the back of the skull (inion), and the preauricular areas anterior to the ears.

The 10/10 and 10/5 electrode configurations are extensions of the original standard 10/20 system. The 10‑10 system derives its electrode placements from landmarks on the skull, such as the nasion (Nz), and the inion (Iz), and the left and right pre-auricular points (LPA and RPA). The 10/10 system differs from the 10/20 system in that the number of electrodes used increases from 21 to 74. In order to account for an increased number of electrodes, the number of locations have to be extended in all directions to keep an even spread of data extracted from the patient&#39;s scalp. However, the 10/10 and 10/5 system are not as widely used as the 10/20 system, especially for clinical applications. As a result, the bulk of our data uses the 10/20 system.

1. **Unipolar Montages Used for Recording**

When recording an EEG signal and writing it to a file as a digital signal represented using 16 bits per sample, a differential voltage must be recorded. The need for this relates to the electrophysiology of an EEG, which is outside the scope of this document. Suffice it to say that for these types of low-voltage signals (typically in the microvolt range) to be useful, differential voltages must be used because the differencing process reduces noise. A unipolar montage refers to the difference between the electrical potential recorded at an electrode, which we refer to as the raw signal, and a reference node (e.g., an electrode connected to the left ear). This differential signal is what is recorded as a digital signal in a data file. All channels are collected as differential voltages, so a configuration of reference points is implied by the data written in a file.

Figure 3. Location information of the electrodes for two montages found in TUEG: a) AR, b) LE.

Two general unipolar montages, which are shown in Figure 3, are used within TUEG: (1) Average Reference (AR) and (2) Linked Ears Reference (LE). The AR montage uses the average of a certain number of electrodes as the reference. The LE montage uses a lead adapter to link the left and right ears, providing a more stable reference point (Lopez et al, 2016). The LE montage is believed to reduce artifacts (Subramaniyam, 2019).

The LE and AR unipolar montages are divided into four classifications in TUEG: 01\_tcp\_ar, 02\_tcp\_le, 03\_tcp\_ar\_a, and 04\_tcp\_le\_a. Each of these montages is based on the types of channels included. The montage labeled 01\_tcp\_ar uses the AR referencing method for the electrodes. The montage 02\_tcp\_le classification uses the LE montage format. The unipolar montages labeled as 03\_tcp\_ar\_a and 04\_tcp\_le\_a use AR and LE formats respectively but are collected with only 20 channels. For these last two subgroups, the auricular channels are excluded (electrodes A1 and A2).

1. **Channel Labels**

Each channel in an EDF file is labeled using a non-standard set of labels. A typical set of these labels is shown in Figure 1. As mentioned previously, a complete set of labels is listed in Appendix B. These labels unfortunately are non-standard. However, the names are often adequately descriptive so that a user can infer the nature and location of the digitized signal. It is important to understand that to access data in a correct and consistent manner, you must pay attention to the channel label. **You cannot assume that the first channel stored in an EDF file always represents the same electrode location.**

Each electrode begins with a letter corresponding to the region where the signals are read from:

 Fp: Prefrontal  P: Parietal/Parasagittal

F: Frontal O: Occipital

T: Temporal A: Mastoid Process (bone near the outer ear)

C: Central

Even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) are used to denote electrodes in the right hemisphere and odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7) refer to those on the left. Each adjacent electrode represents a distance of 10% or 20% of either the total nasion-inion or right-left distance, hence the 10-20 system. &quot;Z&quot; refers to electrodes located on the midsagittal line. For example, Fp1-F3 refers to the signal in the segment between the left prefrontal electrode closest to the nasion and the left frontal electrode closest to the midsagittal line. The signal would represent the brain activity in the imaginary line between these two electrodes.

A complete listing of the channels associated with each of the four unipolar montages is given in Appendix A. Software is available on our project web site (Choi et al., 2017) that demonstrates one way to decode channels properly in Python. Our interface supports simple pattern matching so that channel labels can be easily identified. The software also supports a straightforward way of specifying a montage. Several of our software tools use this format, including our annotation tool (Capp et al., 2017).

Many EEG records in TUEG have at least 19 electrodes, corresponding to the aforementioned 10/20 system. Table 1 lists these electrodes with their corresponding labels. Table 1 also provides a brief description of the location of each electrode. In the AR and LE montages there are 22 signal channels that are derived from the 19 electrodes; this is due to the T3 and T4 electrodes being used twice, both longitudinally and transversely. Along the midsagittal line in the 10/20 system there are five central &quot;Z&quot; channels (Fpz, Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz). However, the bipolar montages applied to the data in TUEG only reference Cz, located at the apex of the scalp.

Table 1. A listing of each of the channel labels in a 10/20 system as represented in TUEG. Channel labels described as &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; are defined based on the distance of that electrode from the vertex node (Cz).

| **Channel Label** | **Position on Scalp** | **Channel Label** | **Position** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fp1 | left forehead | Fp2 | right forehead |
| F7 | left outer frontal | F8 | right outer frontal |
| T3 | left outer medial | T4 | right outer medial |
| T5 | left outer posterior | T6 | right outer posterior |
| O1 | left back of head | O2 | right back of head |
| F3 | left inner frontal | F4 | right inner frontal |
| C3 | left inner medial | C4 | right inner medial |
| P3 | left inner posterior | P4 | right inner posterior |
| A1 | left preauricular area | A2 | right preauricular area |
| Fpz | center forehead | Fz | center frontal |
| Cz | center top | Pz | center inner posterior |
| Oz | center back of head | EKG | electrocardiogram |

Though there are many labels listed in Appendix B, most researchers will probably not use most of these. The labels in Table 1 are most of the useful labels for machine learning research. Our software interface supports partial name matching, which makes dealing with these labels much easier.

1. **Bipolar Montages Used for Viewing**

As mentioned previously, differential voltages are used to reduce noise and enhance events of interest, such as spikes. The electrical signal in the area between adjacent electrodes cancels out noise and artifacts that are due to a common reference point. This often results in a clearer and more easily interpretable signal. However, this method also makes certain electrode combinations more vulnerable to specific artifacts.

When neurologists view the data, they typically impose a bipolar montage to remove signal noise and improve spatial information interpretation of the EEG signal (Shah et al., 2017). We similarly use one of the most popular bipolar Temporal Central Parasagittal (TCP) montages for EEG interpretation and algorithm development. A TCP montage is also known as the double-banana montage. It is shown in Figure 4. This montage uses signals that correspond to the difference between two adjacent electrodes (e.g. FP1­‑F7, T3-C3), in the nasion-inion/longitudinal direction, or transverse across the scalp (left-to-right).

There are a wide range of other montages in use at the TUH. However, the TCP bipolar montage is by far the most popular among neurologists.

The goal of this report is to document how EEG signal data was collected and stored in EDF files for TUEG. We have described how channel ordering, channel labels, and the physical location of a channel can be cross‑referenced through the use of information available in this document and in the header of the EDF file. We have documented the four main montages used in TUEZ and presented an exhaustive list of channel labels. In a companion document we discuss the process of annotating EEG signals and storing these annotations in text files (Ferrell et al., 2019).

To accurately process EEG data in TUEG, you must pay attention to channel ordering and labels. We have also developed software that demonstrates how this can be done in Python. This software is available from our project web site.
